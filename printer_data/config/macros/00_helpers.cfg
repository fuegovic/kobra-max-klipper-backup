# ============================================
# File: 00_helpers.cfg
# Purpose: Common reusable snippets and helper macros
# Safe during print: DEPENDS (only call from other macros)
# Notes:
# - Contains low-level routines like __park_head, __ensure_heaters, __respond_error
# - Should not directly move hardware without explicit macro call
